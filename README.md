This is where I store all the texture packs I have made, these texture pack are mostly aimed at the [Create: Astral Modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-astral),
Each folder is its own texture pack and HyperFix Full is all of them combined. 

The Zipped folder contains the final, zipped texture pack, for easy use.

All the texture packs are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) < More info here.

Do note that the Hyper Full will not but 100% up to date, as I only merge the packs when there is alot of new ones
